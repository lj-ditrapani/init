A start job is running for /sys/subsystem/net/devices/wlo1

Look for files in

    /etc/netplan/

that subiquity created

example

    /etc/netplan/00-installer-config-wifi.yaml
    /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml

Delete these files.
The os is waiting for the interface to be available.  But it will never be.
Because the name is wrong.
In this case, the wifi was named wlo1 when subiquity ran.  But now is named wlan0.
Also, wlan0 is disabled.

These were my old instructions:

    # Redirect to /dev/null 2 minute "waiting for network to be configured" on startup
    systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
    sudo systemctl mask systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
