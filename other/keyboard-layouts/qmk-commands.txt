Clone your fork of qmk to ~/fun/qmk_firmware
cd ~/fun/qmk_firmware
uv tool install qmk
qmk setup

# add
MOUSEKEY_ENABLE = yes
to the keymapâ€™s rules.mK (e.g. keyboards/sofle/keymaps/default/rules.mk)
qmk compile -e CONVERT_TO=promicro_rp2040 ~/fun/init/other/keyboard-layouts/qmk-layout-sofle-ljd-sparkfun.json
qmk compile -e CONVERT_TO=elite_pi ~/fun/init/other/keyboard-layouts/qmk-layout-helix-ljd-elite-pi.json

You can put the rp2040 into boot mode by double pressing the reset button on the keyboard!

Firmware will be in ~/qmk_firmware.
Just copy into usb while micro in boot mode for both micros.
